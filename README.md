GNP2
====

GNP2 is an improvement on GNP, and on Pong games in general. In GNP2 you can play with up to 4 people at a time, or even go back to playing it the classic 1v1. The objective of the 1v1v1v1 is to be the last person to touch the ball before it scores.


<h3>Building from Source</h3>
This game was built using the libGDX libraries, and you will need to use the gradle compiler that comes with the source-code to GNP2.

To compile: go to the source-code directory. If you run Mac or Linux, run <code>./gradlew desktop:dist</code>; if you run Windows, run <code>./gradlew.bat desktop:dist</code>. You will find the JAR file here: <code>desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar</code>.

Those are the instructions for a desktop standalone build. If you wish to target other platforms you can refer to the libGDX documentation <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-on-the-Commandline" >here</a>. However, please take into account that GNP2 is currently only made for Desktop and HTML/Javascript targetting.
